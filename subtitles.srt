1
00:02:08,688 --> 00:02:10,178
May I speak with you, sire

2
00:02:13,271 --> 00:02:14,511
same

3
00:02:18,896 --> 00:02:19,976
same

4
00:02:21,146 --> 00:02:22,386
commander...

5
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:26,102
Him again

6
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:29,469
what now?

7
00:02:30,146 --> 00:02:32,637
He visited jing city yesterday

8
00:02:32,646 --> 00:02:33,646
what?

9
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:35,769
He went to jing

10
00:02:36,396 --> 00:02:37,396
for what?

11
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:39,845
To give Yang a birthday greeting

12
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:41,851
he went yesterday

13
00:02:41,854 --> 00:02:43,845
and you only tell me now?

14
00:02:44,854 --> 00:02:45,854
Pe

15
00:02:45,938 --> 00:02:47,644
My most trusted minister

16
00:02:47,813 --> 00:02:49,599
this is how you serve me?

17
00:02:51,854 --> 00:02:52,969
Has he returned?

18
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:53,979
Not yet

19
00:02:55,146 --> 00:02:56,386
go, wait for him

20
00:02:57,188 --> 00:02:58,188
the minute he returns

21
00:02:58,854 --> 00:03:00,014
bring him to me right away

22
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:01,093
yes, sire

23
00:03:01,188 --> 00:03:07,263
commander's residence

24
00:03:22,396 --> 00:03:23,476
What does it say?

25
00:03:33,063 --> 00:03:34,018
This reading

26
00:03:34,021 --> 00:03:35,352
is about masculine power

27
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:37,515
no place for women here

28
00:03:38,854 --> 00:03:41,470
qian, the male, origin of all things

29
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,810
shall rule the world

30
00:03:43,313 --> 00:03:44,473
this reading

31
00:03:44,688 --> 00:03:45,723
is "qian"

32
00:03:46,521 --> 00:03:47,886
this is heaven's will

33
00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:49,302
brother

34
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:50,598
there's been talk of this in the palace

35
00:03:50,604 --> 00:03:52,595
the reading's also a positive sign

36
00:03:54,438 --> 00:03:55,928
when will the battle begin?

37
00:03:55,938 --> 00:03:57,053
Summer, or Autumn?

38
00:03:57,521 --> 00:03:58,852
The reading says...

39
00:03:59,313 --> 00:04:00,974
Our time will come in seven days

40
00:04:01,354 --> 00:04:02,354
seven days?

41
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:04,682
After seven days of rain

42
00:04:04,688 --> 00:04:06,849
we'll win when the waters rise

43
00:04:08,396 --> 00:04:11,012
the commander enters!

44
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:14,386
Our brave lone hero returns!

45
00:04:14,396 --> 00:04:15,806
Sister

46
00:04:17,938 --> 00:04:19,144
reporting

47
00:04:22,104 --> 00:04:23,184
I've heard

48
00:04:23,604 --> 00:04:26,016
you went to celebrate Yang's birthday

49
00:04:27,354 --> 00:04:30,926
I'm sure you gave a lovely speech

50
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,761
I went to jing to claim one thing

51
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:37,937
the city yan kingdom has
occupied for 20 years

52
00:04:38,104 --> 00:04:39,765
is he willing to return it?

53
00:04:40,604 --> 00:04:42,686
So you declared war?

54
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:44,685
Yang and I have agreed

55
00:04:45,188 --> 00:04:46,519
in a few days, under the city pass

56
00:04:46,521 --> 00:04:47,886
to duel one-on-one

57
00:04:47,896 --> 00:04:49,352
and see who wins

58
00:04:50,063 --> 00:04:52,019
our two nations are allies

59
00:04:52,854 --> 00:04:54,970
a duel between our chief commanders

60
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:56,469
means war

61
00:04:58,021 --> 00:04:59,636
don't you understand this?

62
00:05:00,146 --> 00:05:01,306
He agreed to it

63
00:05:01,771 --> 00:05:02,771
alright then

64
00:05:03,688 --> 00:05:04,688
tell me

65
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:08,596
are you sure you can beat him?

66
00:05:14,688 --> 00:05:16,349
Yes or no?

67
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:21,470
What are your odds?

68
00:05:23,063 --> 00:05:24,303
3 out of 10 at best

69
00:05:24,313 --> 00:05:25,598
absurd

70
00:05:27,313 --> 00:05:32,228
were it not for our peace treaty

71
00:05:32,396 --> 00:05:34,762
pei would have been lost long ago

72
00:05:35,938 --> 00:05:37,599
great work

73
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:41,472
you've ruined everything

74
00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:44,015
jing city still belongs to pei

75
00:05:44,354 --> 00:05:46,345
it's under yan kingdom's occupation

76
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:48,636
every righteous man of pei

77
00:05:48,646 --> 00:05:50,728
longs to win it back

78
00:05:51,313 --> 00:05:53,520
no ruler can oppose his people's will

79
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:55,057
if jing isn't reclaimed

80
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,304
pei will perish under your reign

81
00:05:57,313 --> 00:05:58,098
commander

82
00:05:58,104 --> 00:06:00,095
how dare you say that?

83
00:06:00,313 --> 00:06:02,599
I'd rather never take jing back

84
00:06:02,604 --> 00:06:04,469
than destroy the alliance

85
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,810
on your behalf

86
00:06:05,813 --> 00:06:07,804
I've told them otherwise

87
00:06:07,813 --> 00:06:11,260
and would you also be king on my behalf?

88
00:06:17,313 --> 00:06:18,519
What's done is done

89
00:06:20,521 --> 00:06:22,637
and my punishment?

90
00:06:31,188 --> 00:06:32,188
Alright

91
00:06:34,021 --> 00:06:35,682
let's not argue

92
00:06:35,688 --> 00:06:37,895
father died too early

93
00:06:38,146 --> 00:06:40,603
my sister and I had only each other

94
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:43,936
it was thanks to you, commander

95
00:06:43,938 --> 00:06:46,224
that I finally gained the throne

96
00:06:49,354 --> 00:06:50,764
let's drop the subject

97
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:53,015
sire is right

98
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:57,310
let's just enjoy this rare gathering

99
00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:01,435
I've long heard that

100
00:07:02,063 --> 00:07:07,888
you and your wife play
the most exquisite duets

101
00:07:09,313 --> 00:07:11,349
I've always wanted to hear you

102
00:07:13,104 --> 00:07:14,514
will you play for me?

103
00:07:15,104 --> 00:07:16,264
=

104
00:07:16,271 --> 00:07:17,807
Our kingdom is in distress

105
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:20,099
I'm... not in the mood

106
00:07:20,563 --> 00:07:21,552
commander

107
00:07:21,563 --> 00:07:24,600
don't disappoint the king

108
00:07:26,896 --> 00:07:27,896
yes, please

109
00:07:28,063 --> 00:07:30,054
we'll all enjoy your music

110
00:07:30,313 --> 00:07:31,098
come

111
00:07:31,104 --> 00:07:32,104
bring the zithers

112
00:07:50,146 --> 00:07:51,146
Come

113
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:53,474
come. Come

114
00:07:54,396 --> 00:07:55,681
please

115
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:06,229
What?

116
00:08:07,813 --> 00:08:09,303
I, your king

117
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:13,561
can't get you to play for me?

118
00:08:20,771 --> 00:08:22,102
Commander

119
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:43,677
Es se - = -

120
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:45,053
I am guilty

121
00:08:45,354 --> 00:08:46,969
you haven't started yet

122
00:08:46,979 --> 00:08:48,219
what could you be guilty of?

123
00:08:48,229 --> 00:08:49,969
I will not distract my husband

124
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:52,724
with beautiful sights and sounds

125
00:08:53,813 --> 00:08:55,678
I've sworn to heaven

126
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:58,560
that until the day jing's reclaimed

127
00:08:58,563 --> 00:09:01,475
I'll not play a note of music

128
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:02,389
otherwise

129
00:09:02,396 --> 00:09:03,852
otherwise what?

130
00:09:04,563 --> 00:09:05,928
I'll cut off my finger

131
00:09:06,021 --> 00:09:07,227
to prove my resolve

132
00:09:15,938 --> 00:09:18,224
An impressive vow to heaven

133
00:09:19,729 --> 00:09:22,095
but I am the heaven of pei

134
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:24,470
I've asked you to play

135
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,891
will you not obey me?

136
00:09:28,938 --> 00:09:29,938
Fine then

137
00:09:30,146 --> 00:09:31,511
don't play today

138
00:09:31,521 --> 00:09:33,057
take them away

139
00:09:33,313 --> 00:09:34,313
come

140
00:09:37,271 --> 00:09:38,386
they will play

141
00:09:38,396 --> 00:09:39,636
then I won't listen

142
00:10:09,396 --> 00:10:10,396
Commander

143
00:10:11,563 --> 00:10:13,349
madam is ready for you

144
00:10:37,396 --> 00:10:38,806
Madam's vow

145
00:10:41,646 --> 00:10:43,557
is mine as well

146
00:10:47,604 --> 00:10:48,969
I'll cut my hair

147
00:10:50,188 --> 00:10:51,849
to beg heaven's forgiveness

148
00:10:51,854 --> 00:10:52,934
commander, don't

149
00:10:53,354 --> 00:10:54,309
commander, don't

150
00:10:54,313 --> 00:10:55,769
don't do this

151
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:04,470
Alright, don't play then

152
00:11:05,104 --> 00:11:06,844
no need to make a scene

153
00:11:07,729 --> 00:11:09,435
we'll take our leave

154
00:11:20,771 --> 00:11:24,184
Sire, why did you insist
that commander play?

155
00:11:25,063 --> 00:11:27,145
I was just trying to

156
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:29,057
deflate his arrogance

157
00:11:29,771 --> 00:11:33,468
I'll have to clean up his mess

158
00:11:34,563 --> 00:11:37,726
there's only one option left

159
00:11:40,521 --> 00:11:42,807
Yang's son, ping

160
00:11:43,271 --> 00:11:45,057
has not yet married, right?

161
00:11:45,354 --> 00:11:47,015
Sire means to say...

162
00:11:48,521 --> 00:11:50,637
Marry off my wild sister

163
00:11:51,813 --> 00:11:54,555
shouldn't we ask if she's willing?

164
00:11:54,563 --> 00:11:56,099
I'm her elder brother

165
00:11:56,479 --> 00:11:57,719
no need to ask

166
00:11:59,313 --> 00:12:01,395
you must make Yang understand:

167
00:12:01,771 --> 00:12:04,558
Commander doesn't represent me

168
00:12:05,188 --> 00:12:08,851
we don't intend to take back jing

169
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:10,719
much less start a war

170
00:12:12,729 --> 00:12:14,219
my proposal

171
00:12:14,688 --> 00:12:16,644
will show my sincerity

172
00:12:16,896 --> 00:12:17,896
all right

173
00:12:18,063 --> 00:12:19,644
I'll choose a good day

174
00:12:19,646 --> 00:12:21,352
to go make the proposal

175
00:12:21,354 --> 00:12:22,469
you may leave

176
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:23,479
yes, sire

177
00:13:27,063 --> 00:13:28,269
To play as one

178
00:13:28,271 --> 00:13:30,478
two hearts must beat as one

179
00:13:30,479 --> 00:13:33,095
as is the case with you and madam

180
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,686
I haven't even dared to practice

181
00:13:35,771 --> 00:13:37,261
I deserve to die

182
00:13:38,271 --> 00:13:40,307
had you been exposed

183
00:13:40,313 --> 00:13:42,349
you would indeed deserve to die

184
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:45,312
we'd both deserve to die

185
00:13:45,896 --> 00:13:48,387
you must master the zither

186
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:52,343
and suffer this cut

187
00:13:53,104 --> 00:13:54,104
commander

188
00:13:54,604 --> 00:13:55,719
please proceed

189
00:14:10,896 --> 00:14:12,352
These herbs are harsh

190
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:16,263
in an hour

191
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:17,807
the wound will rot

192
00:14:18,229 --> 00:14:19,810
and look just like mine

193
00:14:28,354 --> 00:14:29,764
Whatever you're holding in...

194
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:31,011
Let it out, you'll feel better

195
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:32,604
let it out!

196
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:36,093
When I was 8 I strayed from my mother

197
00:14:36,104 --> 00:14:38,811
and drifted, lost, through jing city

198
00:14:38,813 --> 00:14:40,644
I passed out from hunger

199
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:42,557
your uncle happened to pass by

200
00:14:45,271 --> 00:14:49,719
I'll never forget that bowl of rice...

201
00:14:51,771 --> 00:14:53,978
I've been here over 20 years...

202
00:14:54,813 --> 00:14:56,349
Your days here

203
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,015
have indeed been hard

204
00:14:58,896 --> 00:15:03,265
I owe you both my deepest gratitude

205
00:15:04,479 --> 00:15:06,094
uncle was a cruel man

206
00:15:07,063 --> 00:15:09,395
every time you tried to escape

207
00:15:09,854 --> 00:15:12,561
he beat you so hard you passed out

208
00:15:13,896 --> 00:15:15,056
this place

209
00:15:16,813 --> 00:15:19,225
is your prison, your cage

210
00:15:21,813 --> 00:15:23,019
press on it for me

211
00:15:31,438 --> 00:15:32,848
And after he died

212
00:15:34,021 --> 00:15:36,808
I put you through such brutal training

213
00:15:36,813 --> 00:15:39,099
you must hate me for it

214
00:15:40,979 --> 00:15:42,560
how could I hate you?

215
00:15:43,688 --> 00:15:46,020
I'd be willing to die in pieces

216
00:15:46,354 --> 00:15:49,346
to repay your gracious kindness

217
00:15:49,938 --> 00:15:53,101
it's Yang who should die in pieces

218
00:15:56,396 --> 00:15:58,057
if you kill him

219
00:15:58,063 --> 00:15:59,928
I'll let you go home

220
00:16:26,854 --> 00:16:27,854
My husband

221
00:16:30,771 --> 00:16:33,558
uncle was so right to choose you

222
00:16:34,313 --> 00:16:36,725
besides looking just like me

223
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:40,472
you're incredibly quick-witted

224
00:16:40,979 --> 00:16:43,971
since making your debut a year ago

225
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:46,307
you've been so good you've fooled them all

226
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:51,344
sometimes I even wonder

227
00:16:51,813 --> 00:16:55,260
if my wife can still tell us apart?

228
00:17:05,396 --> 00:17:06,977
I've found your mother

229
00:17:11,188 --> 00:17:12,348
my mother

230
00:17:15,396 --> 00:17:17,182
she's still alive?

231
00:17:17,188 --> 00:17:19,144
She's still right there in jing

232
00:17:20,729 --> 00:17:23,721
wandering homeless in the streets

233
00:17:24,688 --> 00:17:26,929
I've bought your old house

234
00:17:28,521 --> 00:17:29,636
had everything set up

235
00:17:29,646 --> 00:17:30,931
she's settled in there now

236
00:17:31,146 --> 00:17:32,556
how did you find her?

237
00:17:33,104 --> 00:17:34,890
Does she know I'm still alive?

238
00:17:48,938 --> 00:17:50,769
So you have a huge stake

239
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:52,969
in this battle

240
00:17:54,604 --> 00:17:56,390
after jing's taken

241
00:17:56,396 --> 00:18:00,264
you two can reunite

242
00:18:17,813 --> 00:18:19,474
Your zither needs tuning

243
00:18:27,313 --> 00:18:28,974
Yours is in the major key

244
00:18:28,979 --> 00:18:30,970
the strings need tightening

245
00:18:47,438 --> 00:18:48,723
Thank you

246
00:21:31,938 --> 00:21:32,938
You can go

247
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:48,844
You've got just four hours

248
00:21:49,563 --> 00:21:51,303
to put this ointment on the wound

249
00:21:51,313 --> 00:21:53,395
you can't be a moment late

250
00:22:01,271 --> 00:22:02,636
Your husband

251
00:22:02,646 --> 00:22:04,511
is the most noble,

252
00:22:04,521 --> 00:22:05,761
most strategic,

253
00:22:05,771 --> 00:22:07,682
most admired man in pei

254
00:22:08,688 --> 00:22:09,688
and 1?

255
00:22:10,146 --> 00:22:11,761
But I'm nothing but a servant

256
00:22:12,188 --> 00:22:13,974
nothing more than his shadow

257
00:22:14,313 --> 00:22:15,428
you're not a shadow

258
00:22:18,146 --> 00:22:19,306
you are you

259
00:22:19,313 --> 00:22:21,224
who am I then?

260
00:22:26,521 --> 00:22:27,852
You were born in jing

261
00:22:28,813 --> 00:22:30,895
you yearn to go home

262
00:22:33,104 --> 00:22:34,264
maybe your mother

263
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,227
is waiting at the Lane's end

264
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:40,057
watching every passerby

265
00:22:40,604 --> 00:22:42,310
waiting for your return

266
00:22:48,813 --> 00:22:50,019
Many years ago

267
00:22:52,229 --> 00:22:53,765
my mother went blind

268
00:22:54,479 --> 00:22:56,344
she couldn't even see me

269
00:22:57,646 --> 00:22:59,227
if she were waiting there

270
00:23:02,354 --> 00:23:03,594
she could only listen,

271
00:23:04,521 --> 00:23:07,513
straining to hear the sound of my steps

272
00:23:09,854 --> 00:23:11,264
no earlier, no later

273
00:23:13,021 --> 00:23:14,977
you've suddenly found her,

274
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:19,680
just in time to ensure I'll obediently

275
00:23:19,688 --> 00:23:21,394
fight this battle for you

276
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:27,561
you've kept me caged in secret

277
00:23:28,104 --> 00:23:29,844
do you great, noble people

278
00:23:29,854 --> 00:23:31,936
know what scares me most?

279
00:23:32,521 --> 00:23:34,307
Darkness

280
00:23:35,604 --> 00:23:36,604
no one else

281
00:23:38,604 --> 00:23:39,639
no light

282
00:23:43,438 --> 00:23:44,553
no sound

283
00:23:45,396 --> 00:23:47,182
only me in total darkness

284
00:23:47,813 --> 00:23:49,019
I'd touch everywhere

285
00:23:49,313 --> 00:23:50,313
touch everything

286
00:23:51,354 --> 00:23:53,936
rub every tiny crack in the wall

287
00:23:53,938 --> 00:23:55,678
to keep from going mad

288
00:23:56,271 --> 00:23:58,387
to prove to myself I was still alive

289
00:24:03,854 --> 00:24:10,054
And so you always sleep on the floor

290
00:24:11,688 --> 00:24:13,770
with the lamp lit all night

291
00:24:37,896 --> 00:24:39,727
It's time for you to go to court

292
00:24:42,188 --> 00:24:47,182
the great hall of pei

293
00:24:55,771 --> 00:24:57,477
Who wishes to speak?

294
00:25:03,021 --> 00:25:04,101
I, sire

295
00:25:04,729 --> 00:25:05,729
proceed

296
00:25:06,188 --> 00:25:08,304
I've disobeyed your commands

297
00:25:08,313 --> 00:25:09,974
went to jing and declared war

298
00:25:09,979 --> 00:25:11,594
damaged the alliance

299
00:25:11,896 --> 00:25:13,306
please, sire, punish me

300
00:25:13,313 --> 00:25:14,313
and the punishment?

301
00:25:14,688 --> 00:25:15,688
Beheading

302
00:25:17,313 --> 00:25:18,313
brother

303
00:25:18,688 --> 00:25:19,973
you can't behead him

304
00:25:20,688 --> 00:25:22,303
our kingdom's great hero

305
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:24,224
our great general

306
00:25:24,563 --> 00:25:26,554
you can't be beheaded

307
00:25:26,563 --> 00:25:28,474
how could we do without you?

308
00:25:28,938 --> 00:25:30,098
My dear lu

309
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:32,559
what do you think?

310
00:25:37,271 --> 00:25:38,807
He declared war on his own

311
00:25:38,813 --> 00:25:40,519
put pei at great risk

312
00:25:40,854 --> 00:25:42,094
a grave error indeed

313
00:25:42,604 --> 00:25:43,604
cee ===

314
00:25:44,854 --> 00:25:45,684
all right

315
00:25:45,854 --> 00:25:46,854
brother

316
00:25:48,771 --> 00:25:50,636
I hereby revoke commander's powers

317
00:25:51,188 --> 00:25:53,019
confiscate his sword and seals

318
00:25:53,438 --> 00:25:55,520
henceforth he is a commoner

319
00:25:58,479 --> 00:25:59,479
== ==

320
00:26:12,479 --> 00:26:13,479
Do it

321
00:26:27,229 --> 00:26:31,142
I have no other choice

322
00:26:31,604 --> 00:26:33,390
you see this "ode to peace"?

323
00:26:34,604 --> 00:26:38,267
I wrote it and hung it here

324
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:41,475
as a reminder to us all

325
00:26:41,479 --> 00:26:44,186
the alliance is our lifeblood

326
00:26:45,021 --> 00:26:46,682
anyone who violates it,

327
00:26:46,854 --> 00:26:49,095
lord or subject, will pay the price

328
00:26:49,813 --> 00:26:52,976
we will always keep the peace

329
00:26:53,813 --> 00:26:57,886
never speak of a war you can't win

330
00:26:58,813 --> 00:26:59,848
from this day on,

331
00:27:00,063 --> 00:27:02,429
anyone who speaks of this again

332
00:27:03,104 --> 00:27:04,594
will be instantly beheaded

333
00:27:04,604 --> 00:27:06,765
thank you for sparing my life

334
00:27:07,313 --> 00:27:08,348
I'm leaving

335
00:27:09,521 --> 00:27:10,521
wait

336
00:27:14,104 --> 00:27:15,104
brother

337
00:27:15,354 --> 00:27:16,639
what more do you want?

338
00:27:16,896 --> 00:27:18,432
Nothing

339
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:20,431
I'm just holding court

340
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,178
The commander

341
00:27:29,188 --> 00:27:31,144
has fought countless battles

342
00:27:31,146 --> 00:27:32,761
and suffered many wounds

343
00:27:33,563 --> 00:27:34,769
but the one

344
00:27:35,146 --> 00:27:37,102
that concerns me most

345
00:27:37,563 --> 00:27:39,394
is the wound from Yang's saber

346
00:27:40,063 --> 00:27:42,679
a wound few could recover from

347
00:27:43,438 --> 00:27:44,769
indeed, yes

348
00:27:45,229 --> 00:27:47,265
it still hasn't healed

349
00:27:48,813 --> 00:27:51,054
I've found a rare ointment

350
00:27:51,063 --> 00:27:52,348
that can heal your wound

351
00:27:55,188 --> 00:27:56,268
after you leave today,

352
00:27:56,938 --> 00:28:00,260
who knows when we'll meet again?

353
00:28:01,354 --> 00:28:03,561
I want to see you've used this

354
00:28:03,979 --> 00:28:05,890
so I'll know you'll be alright

355
00:28:07,813 --> 00:28:09,974
why trouble yourself with this?

356
00:28:10,521 --> 00:28:11,727
I'll go back and have my wife...

357
00:28:11,729 --> 00:28:12,889
As I said

358
00:28:16,313 --> 00:28:17,974
I want to apply it myself

359
00:28:36,813 --> 00:28:37,813
Commander's wound

360
00:28:38,521 --> 00:28:39,681
is pei's as well

361
00:28:40,396 --> 00:28:42,261
should any of you prove as loyal

362
00:28:42,604 --> 00:28:44,469
I would serve you the same way

363
00:28:56,646 --> 00:28:57,646
Commander

364
00:28:58,813 --> 00:29:00,019
this wound

365
00:29:03,303 --> 00:29:11,303
looks fresh

366
00:29:13,188 --> 00:29:14,678
you're trying to trick me

367
00:29:15,396 --> 00:29:18,183
I beg sire's punishment

368
00:29:20,604 --> 00:29:22,014
my old wound has healed

369
00:29:22,979 --> 00:29:23,979
this cut

370
00:29:25,229 --> 00:29:26,969
was self-inflicted

371
00:29:28,396 --> 00:29:31,388
my loss to Yang is my greatest shame

372
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,353
this cut is a reminder that

373
00:29:36,063 --> 00:29:37,473
as long as Yang lives,

374
00:29:38,313 --> 00:29:40,304
my wound will never heal

375
00:29:41,354 --> 00:29:42,844
until we reclaim jing

376
00:29:43,271 --> 00:29:45,808
how can we speak of peace?

377
00:29:45,813 --> 00:29:46,813
How dare you

378
00:29:48,396 --> 00:29:50,603
brazenly resist my orders?

379
00:29:50,896 --> 00:29:52,727
I'm a commoner how

380
00:29:53,438 --> 00:29:56,555
I'll have my duel with Yang

381
00:29:57,646 --> 00:29:59,102
why should that concern you?

382
00:30:53,354 --> 00:30:54,354
At court today

383
00:30:54,729 --> 00:30:56,469
the king suddenly challenged him

384
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,891
he handled it well despite the scare

385
00:30:58,896 --> 00:31:00,557
quite impressive

386
00:31:04,188 --> 00:31:05,394
he's good

387
00:31:07,146 --> 00:31:10,263
but no one could tell that wound is new

388
00:31:11,854 --> 00:31:14,220
the king was testing him

389
00:31:20,646 --> 00:31:22,477
My "ode to peace"

390
00:31:23,021 --> 00:31:25,558
is quite well-written

391
00:31:25,563 --> 00:31:27,519
why did you demote commander?

392
00:31:36,604 --> 00:31:37,604
So tell me

393
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:42,556
why'd he have to go cut himself?

394
00:31:44,771 --> 00:31:46,477
Why bother?

395
00:31:46,479 --> 00:31:48,515
To remember the shame of defeat

396
00:31:48,521 --> 00:31:49,886
it was an honorable act

397
00:31:50,896 --> 00:31:52,227
he's not like you

398
00:31:52,438 --> 00:31:53,848
you wouldn't dare retake jing

399
00:31:53,854 --> 00:31:55,469
all you do is compromise

400
00:31:55,479 --> 00:31:56,844
you've become a pitiful joke

401
00:31:57,813 --> 00:31:59,303
I do this all for pei

402
00:31:59,979 --> 00:32:01,515
you think I don't know you?

403
00:32:02,313 --> 00:32:03,769
You do things only for your throne

404
00:32:07,896 --> 00:32:10,228
fine, for my throne...

405
00:32:12,313 --> 00:32:15,476
Which has never been safe for a day

406
00:32:25,396 --> 00:32:27,261
Legend says Yang's great saber

407
00:32:27,271 --> 00:32:29,603
was forged by a master blacksmith

408
00:32:29,604 --> 00:32:31,265
on a night of a full moon

409
00:32:32,271 --> 00:32:35,468
it's destined to take hundreds of lives

410
00:32:35,479 --> 00:32:37,265
as offerings to the saber god

411
00:32:37,271 --> 00:32:38,602
it weighs 40 kilos

412
00:32:39,104 --> 00:32:40,184
glows in the night

413
00:32:40,563 --> 00:32:41,769
glints cold in the day

414
00:32:42,063 --> 00:32:43,428
and kills in three rounds

415
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:02,729
Round one

416
00:33:02,896 --> 00:33:03,931
you're not focused

417
00:33:07,604 --> 00:33:09,686
your mind is elsewhere

418
00:33:34,313 --> 00:33:36,099
Round two

419
00:33:38,229 --> 00:33:39,229
my dear husband

420
00:33:39,479 --> 00:33:40,639
you need to stop

421
00:33:41,771 --> 00:33:42,771
again

422
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:45,386
I fear your strength won't hold

423
00:33:45,396 --> 00:33:46,396
why worry?

424
00:33:47,104 --> 00:33:48,765
It's either you or me

425
00:33:49,396 --> 00:33:50,396
come on

426
00:34:29,646 --> 00:34:30,646
Round three

427
00:34:30,979 --> 00:34:33,265
that was exactly the blow

428
00:34:34,104 --> 00:34:35,685
I took from Yang that day

429
00:34:37,563 --> 00:34:41,135
though I used only half its force,

430
00:34:41,438 --> 00:34:43,178
you're already done for

431
00:34:47,104 --> 00:34:48,104
my dear husband

432
00:34:48,396 --> 00:34:49,396
I'll help you up

433
00:34:57,438 --> 00:35:00,635
Your mind's elsewhere

434
00:35:00,646 --> 00:35:01,931
a distracted mind

435
00:35:01,938 --> 00:35:03,519
means shaky breathing

436
00:35:04,021 --> 00:35:05,227
shaky breathing

437
00:35:05,229 --> 00:35:06,969
means no firm steps

438
00:35:07,604 --> 00:35:08,844
how will you survive

439
00:35:08,854 --> 00:35:10,435
without firm steps?

440
00:35:14,271 --> 00:35:16,353
Have you forgotten who you are?

441
00:35:16,771 --> 00:35:17,771
Tell me

442
00:35:17,979 --> 00:35:19,059
who are you?

443
00:35:21,146 --> 00:35:22,146
What?

444
00:35:26,021 --> 00:35:27,977
You named me after jing city

445
00:35:28,354 --> 00:35:32,142
so I'd never forget our great cause

446
00:35:36,521 --> 00:35:40,594
I only need you because I'm dying

447
00:35:43,063 --> 00:35:45,770
focus on your task

448
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:48,261
forget everything else

449
00:36:24,354 --> 00:36:26,390
Strokes with rhythm

450
00:36:26,854 --> 00:36:28,594
words that dance

451
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,269
my unique style

452
00:36:32,813 --> 00:36:33,848
how exquisite

453
00:36:33,854 --> 00:36:34,559
wonderful

454
00:36:34,563 --> 00:36:35,928
superb calligraphy

455
00:36:35,938 --> 00:36:37,144
truly great

456
00:36:49,313 --> 00:36:50,313
Sister

457
00:36:51,771 --> 00:36:53,557
look at the "pei" I wrote

458
00:36:53,979 --> 00:36:55,264
what do you think?

459
00:37:01,729 --> 00:37:03,219
Lu is here

460
00:37:06,271 --> 00:37:07,727
leave

461
00:37:12,896 --> 00:37:13,896
Humbly reporting

462
00:37:14,521 --> 00:37:16,227
how was your trip to jing?

463
00:37:17,354 --> 00:37:18,810
The yangs have been told

464
00:37:18,813 --> 00:37:20,303
of your marriage proposal

465
00:37:20,313 --> 00:37:21,598
they are quite pleased

466
00:37:21,979 --> 00:37:22,979
good

467
00:37:23,354 --> 00:37:24,354
good

468
00:37:24,771 --> 00:37:25,771
brother

469
00:37:25,938 --> 00:37:26,938
who's getting married?

470
00:37:31,396 --> 00:37:33,307
Without even telling me?

471
00:37:33,313 --> 00:37:34,313
What do you think I am?

472
00:37:34,771 --> 00:37:36,181
A single marriage

473
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:38,227
to make peace between two nations

474
00:37:38,938 --> 00:37:40,178
you're the Princess

475
00:37:40,688 --> 00:37:42,349
you should understand this

476
00:37:42,354 --> 00:37:43,354
I won't do it

477
00:37:43,604 --> 00:37:44,639
go yourself

478
00:37:47,979 --> 00:37:49,344
continue

479
00:37:51,729 --> 00:37:52,514
however

480
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:55,843
to thank them for protecting the city,

481
00:37:55,854 --> 00:37:56,809
the king of yan has offered his daughter

482
00:37:56,813 --> 00:37:58,553
to Yang's son, ping

483
00:37:58,563 --> 00:38:01,635
they can't refuse

484
00:38:01,771 --> 00:38:03,227
so... what do we do?

485
00:38:03,938 --> 00:38:06,179
Well, ping has an idea

486
00:38:06,646 --> 00:38:07,646
which is...?

487
00:38:08,229 --> 00:38:09,685
Sire, may I

488
00:38:09,688 --> 00:38:11,144
brief you privately?

489
00:38:11,146 --> 00:38:12,386
What are you afraid of?

490
00:38:12,396 --> 00:38:13,396
Speak

491
00:38:14,854 --> 00:38:15,854
it's...

492
00:38:17,688 --> 00:38:18,688
Everyone here

493
00:38:18,979 --> 00:38:20,844
has risked his life for me

494
00:38:20,854 --> 00:38:22,185
in front of these men

495
00:38:22,188 --> 00:38:23,928
there can be no secrets

496
00:38:27,063 --> 00:38:28,644
ping proposes

497
00:38:28,979 --> 00:38:30,890
to take Princess as a concubine,

498
00:38:31,229 --> 00:38:32,844
thus fulfilling everyone's wishes

499
00:38:46,063 --> 00:38:47,063
Well that's...

500
00:38:48,104 --> 00:38:49,844
Also a way...

501
00:38:51,063 --> 00:38:54,430
Ping has offered his personal dagger

502
00:38:54,438 --> 00:38:56,178
as an engagement gift

503
00:38:56,604 --> 00:38:58,140
provided sire does not object,

504
00:38:58,146 --> 00:39:00,102
the marriage is confirmed

505
00:39:03,688 --> 00:39:05,679
kill those damn yangs

506
00:39:07,729 --> 00:39:09,219
give me 30,000 soldiers

507
00:39:09,229 --> 00:39:10,719
I'll bathe jing in blood

508
00:39:11,938 --> 00:39:12,723
seize jing city

509
00:39:12,729 --> 00:39:14,560
hack the yangs to pieces

510
00:39:14,563 --> 00:39:15,097
win jing back

511
00:39:15,104 --> 00:39:16,935
don't you dare

512
00:39:17,896 --> 00:39:19,477
have you forgotten my order?

513
00:39:20,146 --> 00:39:22,387
Those who talk of taking jing

514
00:39:22,396 --> 00:39:23,681
shall be beheaded

515
00:39:26,521 --> 00:39:28,057
this is spineless

516
00:39:28,063 --> 00:39:29,098
humiliating

517
00:39:29,104 --> 00:39:30,640
our kingdom will perish

518
00:39:30,646 --> 00:39:31,510
under your reign

519
00:39:31,521 --> 00:39:33,853
tian, how dare you defy the king

520
00:39:34,021 --> 00:39:34,931
drag him out

521
00:39:34,938 --> 00:39:36,394
strip him of his rank

522
00:39:36,396 --> 00:39:37,396
guards

523
00:39:38,688 --> 00:39:39,688
I'l do it

524
00:39:57,313 --> 00:39:59,349
How dare he be so insolent

525
00:40:00,063 --> 00:40:01,724
does he still see you as his king?

526
00:40:05,271 --> 00:40:06,306
Clownish king

527
00:40:10,021 --> 00:40:11,557
sire, tian's words

528
00:40:11,563 --> 00:40:13,303
amount to rebellion

529
00:40:27,438 --> 00:40:29,394
Don't trouble yourself, sire

530
00:40:34,021 --> 00:40:35,021
you...

531
00:40:35,688 --> 00:40:36,688
Sia sia

532
00:40:47,229 --> 00:40:48,469
Step aside

533
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:49,479
Princess

534
00:40:49,563 --> 00:40:50,563
step aside

535
00:41:01,104 --> 00:41:02,890
I'll accept the gift

536
00:41:02,896 --> 00:41:04,386
tell him I agree

537
00:41:09,646 --> 00:41:13,685
Jing practice grounds

538
00:41:48,479 --> 00:41:50,720
You forced me back two steps

539
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,310
good tactic, son

540
00:41:53,896 --> 00:41:55,477
we yangs are known for

541
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:59,427
force, speed and death in three rounds

542
00:41:59,979 --> 00:42:01,719
but responding nimbly to

543
00:42:01,729 --> 00:42:03,139
a master fighter's moves

544
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:05,262
is the true essence of our technique

545
00:42:05,729 --> 00:42:07,685
have you ever fought a true master?

546
00:42:08,688 --> 00:42:09,688
No, not yet

547
00:42:18,271 --> 00:42:19,636
When the pei commander visited

548
00:42:19,646 --> 00:42:20,852
what was your impression?

549
00:42:21,771 --> 00:42:23,511
Just as I'd envisioned him

550
00:42:23,521 --> 00:42:25,011
distinguished and strong

551
00:42:25,438 --> 00:42:28,510
that crippling blow I'd given him...

552
00:42:29,563 --> 00:42:31,053
I was shocked to see

553
00:42:31,063 --> 00:42:32,974
he's recovered completely,

554
00:42:34,604 --> 00:42:35,593
good as new,

555
00:42:35,604 --> 00:42:38,437
poised and gracious as ever

556
00:42:39,146 --> 00:42:40,727
he'd come just to see you, father

557
00:42:40,729 --> 00:42:42,390
he wouldn't dare give offense

558
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,271
ping

559
00:42:46,979 --> 00:42:49,311
you've proposed to take the Princess

560
00:42:49,313 --> 00:42:50,519
as your concubine

561
00:42:50,521 --> 00:42:52,227
isn't that "giving offense"?

562
00:42:53,063 --> 00:42:55,304
I want them to give up trying

563
00:42:55,313 --> 00:42:56,519
to use a marriage

564
00:42:56,521 --> 00:42:57,931
to win jing city back

565
00:42:59,354 --> 00:43:01,060
but I've just been told

566
00:43:01,063 --> 00:43:04,021
they've accepted your engagement gift

567
00:43:04,813 --> 00:43:06,804
don't you think that's odd?

568
00:43:08,521 --> 00:43:09,727
So what?

569
00:43:10,646 --> 00:43:12,261
Their king dismissed their commander

570
00:43:12,271 --> 00:43:13,807
wounded tian

571
00:43:13,813 --> 00:43:15,599
forfeited two great generals

572
00:43:15,604 --> 00:43:17,219
they must all be demoralized

573
00:43:18,104 --> 00:43:19,104
and anyway

574
00:43:19,854 --> 00:43:21,970
if there's any sign of trouble there

575
00:43:21,979 --> 00:43:23,719
our spy will tell us right away,

576
00:43:24,354 --> 00:43:26,015
so there's no need to worry

577
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:27,227
you're right

578
00:43:31,021 --> 00:43:32,021
father

579
00:43:32,271 --> 00:43:34,262
now that the city's stable

580
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:36,353
his majesty has again asked us

581
00:43:36,354 --> 00:43:37,935
to redeploy troops...

582
00:43:37,938 --> 00:43:39,724
The situation's quite tense there

583
00:43:40,021 --> 00:43:41,021
let's do this

584
00:43:41,229 --> 00:43:42,810
keep 800 soldiers here

585
00:43:42,813 --> 00:43:44,349
and send the remaining 30,000

586
00:43:44,354 --> 00:43:45,594
to support his majesty

587
00:43:46,729 --> 00:43:48,139
will we have enough left here?

588
00:43:49,521 --> 00:43:52,354
We have strong natural barriers...

589
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:54,519
And in any case

590
00:43:54,521 --> 00:43:57,058
I and my saber are unbeatable

591
00:43:57,063 --> 00:43:58,223
800 will suffice

592
00:43:58,938 --> 00:43:59,938
let me try

593
00:44:01,771 --> 00:44:03,011
I've often watched you

594
00:44:03,646 --> 00:44:05,352
I think I understand it

595
00:44:06,396 --> 00:44:09,228
pei umbrellas are soft and flexible

596
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:11,015
they work best in the rain

597
00:44:11,021 --> 00:44:12,852
they are water weapons

598
00:44:13,021 --> 00:44:14,056
water is yin

599
00:44:14,646 --> 00:44:16,932
Yang's moves are hard and fierce

600
00:44:16,938 --> 00:44:18,098
like fire

601
00:44:18,104 --> 00:44:19,184
fire is Yang

602
00:44:19,563 --> 00:44:20,803
yin counters Yang

603
00:44:20,813 --> 00:44:22,804
water puts out fire

604
00:44:22,813 --> 00:44:23,973
and so

605
00:44:23,979 --> 00:44:26,470
wield it with feminine moves

606
00:44:26,479 --> 00:44:27,719
what do you think?

607
00:44:28,229 --> 00:44:30,185
Feminine moves?

608
00:44:35,979 --> 00:44:37,890
I designed this taichi diagram

609
00:44:40,229 --> 00:44:42,015
why haven't I thought of this?

610
00:44:46,479 --> 00:44:48,561
Watch us from the side

611
00:44:48,563 --> 00:44:49,769
madam

612
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:50,771
come

613
00:45:17,688 --> 00:45:18,688
Madam

614
00:45:19,479 --> 00:45:20,844
practice with jing

615
00:45:21,479 --> 00:45:23,015
teach him quickly

616
00:45:38,813 --> 00:45:39,973
What are you waiting for?

617
00:45:41,104 --> 00:45:43,720
If we don't find a way to beat Yang

618
00:45:43,729 --> 00:45:45,970
we'll have wasted all our efforts

619
00:45:58,771 --> 00:46:00,102
This will be another

620
00:46:00,688 --> 00:46:02,804
Yang-style saber round

621
00:46:03,146 --> 00:46:04,556
hug tight together

622
00:46:05,313 --> 00:46:07,349
if our minds can meld as one

623
00:46:07,354 --> 00:46:09,015
you'll grasp the technique

624
00:46:10,396 --> 00:46:11,396
quickly

625
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:15,646
madam

626
00:46:16,229 --> 00:46:17,469
pardon me

627
00:47:19,188 --> 00:47:20,223
This is it

628
00:47:22,896 --> 00:47:23,896
this is it

629
00:47:24,646 --> 00:47:25,646
this is it

630
00:47:33,188 --> 00:47:34,473
This is it

631
00:47:38,771 --> 00:47:39,771
get up

632
00:47:42,104 --> 00:47:43,890
though Yang's attacks are fierce

633
00:47:43,896 --> 00:47:46,103
he loses stamina fast

634
00:47:47,438 --> 00:47:48,438
= == tee es

635
00:47:49,188 --> 00:47:51,179
if you apply madam's technique

636
00:47:51,188 --> 00:47:52,519
you can kill him

637
00:47:52,854 --> 00:47:53,974
= = = creams sees ee ae - aa

638
00:47:59,104 --> 00:48:01,186
There's someone you must go see

639
00:48:01,438 --> 00:48:02,553
you can leave now

640
00:48:03,021 --> 00:48:04,021
en ===

641
00:48:11,813 --> 00:48:13,178
Your hearts and minds

642
00:48:14,771 --> 00:48:17,137
were truly at one just now

643
00:48:18,438 --> 00:48:20,599
we were merely copying your moves...

644
00:48:21,521 --> 00:48:23,261
Why speak of hearts and minds?

645
00:48:24,313 --> 00:48:25,313
Can he win?

646
00:48:26,146 --> 00:48:27,886
Your technique

647
00:48:27,896 --> 00:48:29,932
can give jing confidence

648
00:48:29,938 --> 00:48:32,099
he has to believe

649
00:48:32,104 --> 00:48:33,685
he can win

650
00:48:33,688 --> 00:48:35,553
in order to last three rounds

651
00:48:36,229 --> 00:48:37,890
and after three rounds?

652
00:48:38,563 --> 00:48:40,975
I'll just need an hour

653
00:49:19,146 --> 00:49:21,933
That lingering, echoing melody

654
00:49:21,938 --> 00:49:24,054
felt trapped, with no way out

655
00:49:24,063 --> 00:49:25,428
that must be

656
00:49:25,438 --> 00:49:27,645
how you're feeling, sir

657
00:49:32,021 --> 00:49:34,012
you know what lies beyond the forest?

658
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:37,099
100 convicts in hiding

659
00:49:37,479 --> 00:49:39,094
they live for fighting and killing

660
00:49:39,646 --> 00:49:41,762
yet look strangely gentle

661
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,431
I've promised

662
00:49:44,438 --> 00:49:47,225
to let them go free if they reclaim jing

663
00:49:47,896 --> 00:49:49,432
I brought them there to train,

664
00:49:49,438 --> 00:49:51,178
yet couldn't find a winning technique

665
00:49:51,771 --> 00:49:53,056
but now we have a way

666
00:49:53,063 --> 00:49:54,894
learn it, train them

667
00:49:54,896 --> 00:49:56,306
become their leader

668
00:49:57,104 --> 00:49:58,104
yes, sir

669
00:50:01,521 --> 00:50:02,727
take this flute

670
00:50:02,729 --> 00:50:03,844
when you play it

671
00:50:03,854 --> 00:50:06,220
they'll know you've been sent by me

672
00:50:06,229 --> 00:50:07,719
and they'll obey you

673
00:50:08,271 --> 00:50:10,057
I'll do as you say, commander

674
00:50:12,104 --> 00:50:14,186
commander wants to see you

675
00:50:59,688 --> 00:51:00,688
Commander

676
00:51:03,896 --> 00:51:06,137
I'm neither man nor ghost

677
00:51:06,854 --> 00:51:09,061
not the commander you've known

678
00:51:09,063 --> 00:51:11,145
you will always be my commander

679
00:51:16,396 --> 00:51:18,478
In the mang river battle

680
00:51:19,396 --> 00:51:20,681
you killed a dozen men

681
00:51:21,896 --> 00:51:24,057
to save my life

682
00:51:24,813 --> 00:51:27,020
suffered over twenty wounds

683
00:51:27,021 --> 00:51:30,138
lay in a coma for three days

684
00:51:32,188 --> 00:51:35,225
my little cut is nothing

685
00:51:35,229 --> 00:51:36,719
come

686
00:51:36,729 --> 00:51:37,729
1

687
00:51:39,521 --> 00:51:40,931
When I was eight

688
00:51:42,771 --> 00:51:44,307
on the first day of spring

689
00:51:46,646 --> 00:51:47,852
father

690
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:49,469
was assassinated

691
00:51:50,021 --> 00:51:51,261
it happened in court

692
00:51:53,271 --> 00:51:54,761
in front of all the ministers

693
00:51:54,771 --> 00:51:56,636
the killer

694
00:51:57,479 --> 00:51:58,889
cut his head off

695
00:51:58,896 --> 00:52:00,682
with an ax

696
00:52:02,188 --> 00:52:04,474
uncle worried I'd meet the same fate

697
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:06,686
he searched everywhere

698
00:52:07,688 --> 00:52:09,474
at last, in jing city

699
00:52:09,854 --> 00:52:12,186
he found a boy my age

700
00:52:12,854 --> 00:52:15,061
who looked just like me

701
00:52:16,063 --> 00:52:19,135
he brought him here for secret training,

702
00:52:21,021 --> 00:52:25,515
hoping to shield me from palace intrigue

703
00:52:25,521 --> 00:52:27,182
to protect me

704
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:31,478
that boy's become the "shadow"

705
00:52:33,063 --> 00:52:35,850
my wound worsened last year

706
00:52:35,854 --> 00:52:36,934
my health failed

707
00:52:36,938 --> 00:52:39,054
I suddenly aged

708
00:52:39,063 --> 00:52:41,270
no one is to know this...

709
00:52:41,271 --> 00:52:43,808
So you started using the shadow

710
00:52:45,146 --> 00:52:46,306
but madam, does she...

711
00:52:46,313 --> 00:52:47,598
Madam knows

712
00:52:50,813 --> 00:52:52,303
she pities him

713
00:52:53,646 --> 00:52:55,136
she's urged me

714
00:52:55,646 --> 00:52:57,136
to let him go home

715
00:52:59,396 --> 00:53:01,011
I called you here today

716
00:53:02,229 --> 00:53:03,514
so she can show you

717
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:06,020
how to defeat Yang

718
00:53:06,854 --> 00:53:07,854
I see...

719
00:53:15,146 --> 00:53:17,057
That day the king inspected his wound...

720
00:53:17,896 --> 00:53:18,896
Did he already

721
00:53:19,646 --> 00:53:21,511
suspect he's a "shadow"?

722
00:53:24,438 --> 00:53:26,053
What do you think?

723
00:53:28,354 --> 00:53:29,354
Commander

724
00:53:29,938 --> 00:53:32,054
why stay locked in this narrow cell

725
00:53:32,063 --> 00:53:34,395
trying to read the king's mind?

726
00:53:34,396 --> 00:53:35,852
Why not replace him

727
00:53:35,854 --> 00:53:36,854
and become our king?

728
00:53:37,479 --> 00:53:39,185
There's not a general or soldier

729
00:53:39,563 --> 00:53:41,144
who'd hesitate to support you

730
00:53:41,146 --> 00:53:42,352
what impudence!

731
00:53:42,354 --> 00:53:43,354
Sorry

732
00:53:44,271 --> 00:53:46,603
the king serves his purpose

733
00:53:56,854 --> 00:53:57,854
Are very good

734
00:54:00,354 --> 00:54:02,390
you've always been good

735
00:54:09,229 --> 00:54:10,969
To win jing back

736
00:54:11,479 --> 00:54:12,969
I'll need three people

737
00:54:14,104 --> 00:54:15,104
one is the shadow

738
00:54:15,854 --> 00:54:16,969
one the king

739
00:54:16,979 --> 00:54:19,140
and the third is you

740
00:54:20,396 --> 00:54:22,182
from this tiny cell

741
00:54:22,563 --> 00:54:24,053
I'll launch my scheme

742
00:54:24,729 --> 00:54:26,970
and watch you each play your part,

743
00:54:26,979 --> 00:54:29,140
reclaiming our land on my behalf

744
00:54:29,146 --> 00:54:31,057
won't it be thrilling?

745
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:35,390
And then?

746
00:54:36,813 --> 00:54:37,893
I will

747
00:54:37,896 --> 00:54:39,136
be king

748
00:54:41,938 --> 00:54:43,894
you'll be commander

749
00:55:18,229 --> 00:55:19,435
Sorry

750
00:55:29,438 --> 00:55:31,144
You're more like the commander

751
00:55:31,146 --> 00:55:32,602
than he is

752
00:55:32,979 --> 00:55:34,014
for a moment there

753
00:55:34,729 --> 00:55:36,811
I didn't know how to react

754
00:55:39,979 --> 00:55:41,344
I've been your commander

755
00:55:42,771 --> 00:55:44,511
I'll still be your commander

756
00:55:45,854 --> 00:55:47,310
that's all there is

757
00:56:18,646 --> 00:56:20,056
Yang's saber technique

758
00:56:20,521 --> 00:56:21,852
is hard and strong

759
00:56:22,563 --> 00:56:23,348
wield your umbrellas

760
00:56:23,354 --> 00:56:25,766
with feminine moves

761
00:56:25,771 --> 00:56:27,636
borrow the slickness of the rain

762
00:56:27,813 --> 00:56:29,678
using yin to counter Yang

763
00:56:29,688 --> 00:56:31,428
is our only way to win

764
00:56:33,646 --> 00:56:35,557
nonstop clouds and rain

765
00:56:35,563 --> 00:56:37,428
we'll win when the waters rise

766
00:56:38,146 --> 00:56:40,307
it's rained for four days

767
00:56:40,646 --> 00:56:42,136
if it rains for three more

768
00:56:42,146 --> 00:56:43,636
the river water will rise

769
00:56:43,646 --> 00:56:45,682
and submerge jing's storm drain

770
00:56:49,521 --> 00:56:52,638
commander rightly chose
this moment for the duel

771
00:56:52,646 --> 00:56:53,931
whatever happens, win or lose

772
00:56:53,938 --> 00:56:55,644
the moment has arrived

773
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:57,469
false, true

774
00:56:57,479 --> 00:56:59,515
true, false

775
00:56:59,854 --> 00:57:01,594
just like in a game of chess

776
00:57:04,396 --> 00:57:05,431
but who, after all

777
00:57:05,938 --> 00:57:07,644
are the pawns?

778
00:57:09,063 --> 00:57:10,599
So turning me into a concubine

779
00:57:13,479 --> 00:57:14,764
was also a move in your game?

780
00:57:14,771 --> 00:57:16,636
Just an improvised ploy,

781
00:57:16,646 --> 00:57:18,386
a decoy move

782
00:57:18,688 --> 00:57:20,019
and the real move, then?

783
00:57:20,646 --> 00:57:22,511
Tell me then, what is real?

784
00:57:30,354 --> 00:57:31,354
To tomorrow

785
00:57:32,146 --> 00:57:33,556
to a swift victory

786
00:57:44,521 --> 00:57:46,386
You left home so young

787
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:48,594
do you know your way back?

788
00:57:49,896 --> 00:57:50,976
I think so

789
00:57:52,563 --> 00:57:54,724
you'll be able to find it?

790
00:58:00,396 --> 00:58:03,103
They say a pup taken at birth

791
00:58:04,229 --> 00:58:06,015
can find its birthplace

792
00:58:06,021 --> 00:58:07,602
by tracing the scent

793
00:58:10,729 --> 00:58:12,640
I've been yearning to return

794
00:58:13,896 --> 00:58:15,227
I know I can find it

795
00:58:18,688 --> 00:58:19,928
actually

796
00:58:21,896 --> 00:58:23,761
I also long to go home

797
00:58:30,229 --> 00:58:32,140
But isn't pei your home?

798
00:58:35,313 --> 00:58:37,304
Home has many meanings

799
00:58:45,938 --> 00:58:46,938
Isis ee

800
00:58:50,271 --> 00:58:51,681
to a swift victory

801
00:59:16,979 --> 00:59:17,979
I know

802
00:59:19,479 --> 00:59:20,889
I can't win tomorrow

803
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:27,021
Actually

804
00:59:29,688 --> 00:59:31,804
you've had many chances to refuse

805
00:59:33,104 --> 00:59:34,685
you could have run away

806
00:59:38,063 --> 00:59:39,063
why didn't you?

807
00:59:40,354 --> 00:59:42,310
You've always seemed so obedient

808
00:59:43,688 --> 00:59:45,303
so willing to do this

809
00:59:47,854 --> 00:59:48,854
because of you

810
00:59:51,688 --> 00:59:52,803
when I was young

811
00:59:52,813 --> 00:59:54,178
I was being forced

812
00:59:56,104 --> 00:59:57,344
but since I've grown older

813
00:59:58,146 --> 00:59:59,181
and come to know you

814
00:59:59,188 --> 01:00:00,928
I've only had one thing in mind

815
01:00:01,688 --> 01:00:03,019
I would do

816
01:00:03,896 --> 01:00:05,761
anything for you

817
01:00:15,146 --> 01:00:16,727
In tomorrow's fight

818
01:00:16,729 --> 01:00:18,685
I'll be just a decoy

819
01:00:21,854 --> 01:00:24,766
no one cares whether a decoy lives or dies

820
01:00:24,771 --> 01:00:26,261
I care

821
01:00:44,604 --> 01:00:46,060
Tonight

822
01:00:50,354 --> 01:00:52,515
is the last you'll spend here

823
01:01:21,938 --> 01:01:22,938
Madam

824
01:01:26,063 --> 01:01:27,063
thank you

825
01:05:04,604 --> 01:05:05,639
Reporting to general Yang

826
01:05:05,646 --> 01:05:07,386
the pei commander has arrived alone

827
01:05:07,396 --> 01:05:08,932
says he's come as agreed

828
01:05:26,521 --> 01:05:32,517
Jing city pass

829
01:06:01,646 --> 01:06:02,646
Father

830
01:06:03,229 --> 01:06:06,016
how'd the ship slip through so easily?

831
01:06:08,563 --> 01:06:10,394
Some sort of cheap trick

832
01:06:30,521 --> 01:06:32,933
Our foolish king has dismissed me

833
01:06:34,146 --> 01:06:35,146
I've no power

834
01:06:35,729 --> 01:06:36,729
no soldiers

835
01:06:37,563 --> 01:06:39,428
honor our gentlemen's agreement

836
01:06:39,771 --> 01:06:40,886
duel with this commoner

837
01:06:41,646 --> 01:06:43,386
to see who prevails

838
01:06:48,188 --> 01:06:49,188
father

839
01:06:49,646 --> 01:06:51,182
something seems odd

840
01:06:52,104 --> 01:06:54,060
that's a taichi diagram on the deck

841
01:06:54,396 --> 01:06:55,636
it could be a trap

842
01:06:57,063 --> 01:06:58,223
it's just hocus pocus

843
01:06:59,146 --> 01:07:00,886
I'm curious to see

844
01:07:00,896 --> 01:07:02,932
what game he's playing

845
01:07:03,438 --> 01:07:04,928
I know you've agreed to do this

846
01:07:04,938 --> 01:07:06,394
but you should still be cautious

847
01:07:06,854 --> 01:07:08,214
how about bringing a few soldiers?

848
01:07:09,729 --> 01:07:11,560
We two have a gentlemen's agreement

849
01:07:11,896 --> 01:07:13,306
he's come alone

850
01:07:13,313 --> 01:07:14,894
if I bring soldiers

851
01:07:14,896 --> 01:07:16,386
won't I look like a fool?

852
01:07:16,396 --> 01:07:17,396
My saber

853
01:07:20,729 --> 01:07:21,729
father

854
01:07:22,313 --> 01:07:23,313
please be careful

855
01:07:25,646 --> 01:07:26,646
guard the pass

856
01:07:27,188 --> 01:07:28,268
protect the banner

857
01:07:29,563 --> 01:07:30,393
yes, sir

858
01:07:30,396 --> 01:07:31,852
I'll guard it with my life

859
01:07:33,354 --> 01:07:36,426
watch how I teach him a lesson

860
01:08:36,354 --> 01:08:37,354
Princess?

861
01:08:39,271 --> 01:08:40,511
Princess

862
01:09:36,354 --> 01:09:37,594
This is a pei umbrella

863
01:09:38,396 --> 01:09:40,182
made specially for this duel

864
01:09:40,813 --> 01:09:42,599
I humbly request the general's

865
01:09:42,604 --> 01:09:44,140
teaching and guidance

866
01:10:11,438 --> 01:10:12,438
Round one

867
01:10:15,229 --> 01:10:16,229
I can see

868
01:10:17,354 --> 01:10:19,436
you've taken great pains to prepare

869
01:10:19,979 --> 01:10:21,264
I couldn't dare do otherwise

870
01:11:47,854 --> 01:11:48,854
Round two

871
01:12:05,563 --> 01:12:08,145
Each man's crossbow has only 12 arrows

872
01:12:08,146 --> 01:12:10,011
so move right through, don't bog down

873
01:13:28,313 --> 01:13:29,177
Young general

874
01:13:29,188 --> 01:13:30,553
there are enemies in the city

875
01:13:38,604 --> 01:13:40,640
Remove crossbows

876
01:13:44,188 --> 01:13:46,395
open umbrellas

877
01:13:53,604 --> 01:13:54,719
Sie aera senn see ==

878
01:14:01,188 --> 01:14:02,188
Block

879
01:14:23,646 --> 01:14:24,761
Ping

880
01:15:13,896 --> 01:15:15,727
Round three

881
01:15:16,396 --> 01:15:17,396
well done

882
01:15:20,479 --> 01:15:22,936
never in our family's history

883
01:15:22,938 --> 01:15:23,938
has anyone

884
01:15:25,104 --> 01:15:26,469
against the Yang saber

885
01:15:28,813 --> 01:15:29,813
not bad

886
01:15:30,271 --> 01:15:31,556
I'll save face for you

887
01:15:31,563 --> 01:15:32,598
let's call it a draw

888
01:15:32,604 --> 01:15:33,889
and stop here

889
01:15:40,729 --> 01:15:41,729
Let's go again

890
01:15:42,188 --> 01:15:43,303
we agreed to duel

891
01:15:43,938 --> 01:15:45,303
to determine a winner

892
01:15:46,146 --> 01:15:47,431
if we keep going now

893
01:15:47,688 --> 01:15:49,394
it will be for life or death

894
01:15:50,104 --> 01:15:51,104
come

895
01:16:06,021 --> 01:16:07,682
Jing city is taken

896
01:17:40,563 --> 01:17:42,099
Why doesn't a girl like you

897
01:17:42,104 --> 01:17:43,719
stay home where you belong?

898
01:17:44,188 --> 01:17:45,598
Did you come looking to die?

899
01:17:46,563 --> 01:17:48,019
You've insulted me

900
01:17:49,229 --> 01:17:50,435
insulted you?

901
01:17:50,938 --> 01:17:51,938
I don't even know you

902
01:17:54,771 --> 01:17:56,602
said you'd make me your concubine

903
01:18:01,104 --> 01:18:02,104
that was you?

904
01:18:08,979 --> 01:18:10,469
Sen

905
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:13,719
I'm here to give this back to you

906
01:18:15,063 --> 01:18:16,063
what?

907
01:19:31,563 --> 01:19:32,563
Dear wife

908
01:19:33,813 --> 01:19:35,269
using the shadow

909
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:37,769
was I right, or wrong?

910
01:19:39,604 --> 01:19:40,935
Some things

911
01:19:42,104 --> 01:19:43,435
don't have a right or wrong

912
01:19:45,313 --> 01:19:46,678
what's done is done

913
01:20:07,104 --> 01:20:08,104
Dear husband

914
01:20:09,771 --> 01:20:10,771
here, now

915
01:20:12,188 --> 01:20:14,270
let's play our music together

916
01:21:18,188 --> 01:21:21,476
Jing is taken

917
01:21:29,604 --> 01:21:35,554
Jing is taken

918
01:21:36,896 --> 01:21:37,896
ping

919
01:25:05,229 --> 01:25:06,229
Mother

920
01:25:33,729 --> 01:25:35,720
Commander promised to let me go

921
01:25:40,146 --> 01:25:42,558
commander promised to let me go

922
01:26:33,396 --> 01:26:35,808
I've been ordered not to look at your face

923
01:26:36,813 --> 01:26:38,223
on whose order?

924
01:26:39,521 --> 01:26:40,636
The king's

925
01:26:46,313 --> 01:26:47,849
Would you like to go back?

926
01:26:54,813 --> 01:26:55,813
Where is she?

927
01:26:59,729 --> 01:27:00,969
Where is she?

928
01:27:03,521 --> 01:27:04,521
Where is she?

929
01:27:12,063 --> 01:27:13,063
A == en = -_- a see

930
01:27:43,188 --> 01:27:44,223

931
01:27:45,188 --> 01:27:46,724
used ping's dagger

932
01:27:47,354 --> 01:27:49,219
to kill him

933
01:28:44,813 --> 01:28:46,394
Today we celebrate

934
01:28:48,146 --> 01:28:50,853
the reclaiming of our homeland

935
01:28:54,688 --> 01:28:56,178
the first toast

936
01:28:57,188 --> 01:28:58,928

Treated you as my closest confidant?

975
01:33:48,313 --> 01:33:50,725
made our victory possible

976
01:33:51,188 --> 01:33:53,850
how much gold did he pay you?

977
01:34:19,938 --> 01:34:22,725
Surprised I killed him myself?

978
01:34:25,104 --> 01:34:27,140
It's because I'm truly happy

979
01:34:28,104 --> 01:34:29,389
when he conveyed my marriage offer

980
01:34:29,396 --> 01:34:31,512
Yang paid him a bribe, and he came back

981
01:34:31,521 --> 01:34:34,308
proposing my sister be made a concubine

982
01:34:34,313 --> 01:34:36,349
I don't care whose idea it was

983
01:34:36,354 --> 01:34:38,390
I had to take back that pound of flesh

984
01:34:50,813 --> 01:34:52,428
Now that you're back

985
01:34:52,729 --> 01:34:54,435
my mind is at ease

986
01:34:57,104 --> 01:34:58,104
see =

987
01:34:58,604 --> 01:35:00,219
are a true talent

988
01:35:00,979 --> 01:35:03,345
our kingdom can't do without you

989
01:35:09,479 --> 01:35:10,514
Alike

990
01:35:11,604 --> 01:35:13,515
very much alike

991
01:35:15,438 --> 01:35:16,974
don't you agree?

992
01:35:19,729 --> 01:35:20,764
You know

993
01:35:21,813 --> 01:35:23,428
there's been one thing

994
01:35:23,438 --> 01:35:25,349
weighing on my mind

995
01:35:25,354 --> 01:35:27,640
even more than retaking jing

996
01:35:27,646 --> 01:35:29,978
it's been keeping me up at night

997
01:35:30,813 --> 01:35:33,885
but all I could do was wait...

998
01:35:37,229 --> 01:35:38,810
Wait for you

999
01:35:39,979 --> 01:35:41,560
you've won my city back for me

1000
01:35:41,563 --> 01:35:44,851
now let me do something for you

1001
01:35:48,521 --> 01:35:50,386
there's no one here but us

1002
01:35:50,729 --> 01:35:52,390
let me put this simply

1003
01:35:53,146 --> 01:35:54,636
a fake couple

1004
01:35:54,646 --> 01:35:56,227
is no match for a real one

1005
01:35:57,938 --> 01:36:00,600
I will make your wish come true

1006
01:36:04,063 --> 01:36:06,429
and as for commander

1007
01:36:06,438 --> 01:36:08,929
he wants to be honored forever

1008
01:36:08,938 --> 01:36:11,350
his wish will also come true

1009
01:36:11,979 --> 01:36:13,890
a king's duty

1010
01:36:13,896 --> 01:36:17,218
is to make men's dreams come true

1011
01:36:18,271 --> 01:36:19,852
when we step out of this hall

1012
01:36:19,854 --> 01:36:21,014
the world

1013
01:36:21,021 --> 01:36:23,103
will know only one commander

1014
01:36:25,021 --> 01:36:27,854
the obedient and loyal one

1015
01:36:28,396 --> 01:36:30,762
you and I, king and commander

1016
01:36:30,771 --> 01:36:32,727
the two of us

1017
01:36:33,396 --> 01:36:35,057
what do you say?

1018
01:36:41,188 --> 01:36:43,429
I knew you'd come back

1019
01:36:44,063 --> 01:36:46,554
only a fool wouldn't have

1020
01:36:52,104 --> 01:36:54,641
A young, vital husband

1021
01:36:54,646 --> 01:36:55,852
at your side day and night

1022
01:36:56,979 --> 01:36:58,890
what do you say, madam?

1023
01:37:16,813 --> 01:37:18,144
Good

1024
01:37:20,396 --> 01:37:22,853
you've come just in time

1025
01:37:22,854 --> 01:37:26,893
from now on I'll sleep well at night

1026
01:37:54,729 --> 01:37:56,560
Don't you want revenge?

1027
01:37:59,146 --> 01:38:00,386
For years

1028
01:38:00,396 --> 01:38:02,682
I've been misunderstood

1029
01:38:04,021 --> 01:38:05,101
finally

1030
01:38:07,229 --> 01:38:09,311
we can both find relief

1031
01:39:01,188 --> 01:39:03,304
Did you all expect

1032
01:39:03,313 --> 01:39:04,598
my head

1033
01:39:04,604 --> 01:39:06,890
to be in the box?

1034
01:39:09,396 --> 01:39:11,853
There's something all in pei know

1035
01:39:13,063 --> 01:39:14,428
that only he

1036
01:39:16,813 --> 01:39:18,678
never grasped:

1037
01:39:24,563 --> 01:39:27,475
Who am the heaven of pei

1038
01:39:33,979 --> 01:39:35,014
Without the real

1039
01:39:35,021 --> 01:39:37,057
there can be no shadow

1040
01:39:37,938 --> 01:39:40,850
a principle no one's understood

1041
01:39:45,313 --> 01:39:47,554
sent assassins to ambush me

1042
01:39:49,063 --> 01:39:51,395
you had jing's mother killed

1043
01:39:51,396 --> 01:39:52,886
and put the blame on me

1044
01:39:54,729 --> 01:39:56,265
how can someone so vile

1045
01:39:56,771 --> 01:39:59,353
be king of pei?

1046
01:40:07,438 --> 01:40:08,427
Dear husband...

1047
01:40:08,438 --> 01:40:09,974
Never mind me

1048
01:40:12,521 --> 01:40:14,728
I don't have much time left

1049
01:40:14,729 --> 01:40:15,844
leave all of this

1050
01:40:17,229 --> 01:40:18,810
to me

1051
01:40:20,771 --> 01:40:21,886
ze ee=ce3==

1052
01:40:24,146 --> 01:40:25,477
ze ee=ce3==

1053
01:40:28,521 --> 01:40:29,521
kill him

1054
01:40:29,979 --> 01:40:31,719
avenge your mother

1055
01:40:32,188 --> 01:40:34,474
then take madam with you

1056
01:40:50,104 --> 01:40:52,060
I've spent my life

1057
01:40:55,188 --> 01:40:58,260
on power games and war

1058
01:41:00,396 --> 01:41:04,014
never tasted the beauty of the world

1059
01:41:05,521 --> 01:41:07,637
go live it for me

1060
01:41:10,229 --> 01:41:11,344
te ee te a ♪ = ==

1061
01:41:12,188 --> 01:41:13,974
the further the better

1062
01:42:42,938 --> 01:42:44,053
Commander

1063
01:42:46,438 --> 01:42:47,974
without the real

1064
01:42:48,646 --> 01:42:50,432
there is still a shadow

1065
01:42:51,354 --> 01:42:53,470
you should have grasped this long ago

1066
01:43:28,979 --> 01:43:30,264
I'l summon the palace doctor

1067
01:43:31,938 --> 01:43:33,018
stay calm

1068
01:46:50,854 --> 01:46:52,685
An assassin attacked our king

1069
01:46:53,396 --> 01:46:55,227
the king is dead

1070
01:46:55,938 --> 01:46:57,849
I, your commander

1071
01:46:57,854 --> 01:46:59,719
killed the assassin

1072
01:46:59,729 --> 01:47:01,936
on the spot
